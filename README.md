# Corona

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.
It is deployed here: [COVID-19 cases - figurers and plots ](https://coronaservice.z6.web.core.windows.net)

## Authoring
You need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed on your computer.

Open the cloned directory in VS Code and in a Terminal do this:
* `npm install` - this takes several minutes when doing it the first time.
* `ng serve -o` - this starts the integrated web server, compiles and opens `http://localhost:4200` in your default web browser.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
