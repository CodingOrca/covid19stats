    <a href="https://github.com/NovelCOVID" target="_blank">NovelCOVID</a>.<br>
    For every day since the beginning of case reporting, we define the following indicators:
    <dl>
        <dt>&Delta;T - new cases; &Delta;R - new recovered; &Delta;D - new deaths.</dt>
        <dt>T - cumulated reported cases </dt>
        <dt>R - cumulated recovered cases</dt>
        <dt>A - currently active cases</dt>
        <dt>C - currently critical cases (subset of A)</dt>
        <dt>D - cumulated deaths</dt>
        <dt>R<sub>0</sub> (<b>Experimental!</b>) - the expected average number of persons which will be infected by one infected person.
        The estimation of the reproduction number for each day is assuming that on average an infected person is isolated after 
        5 days of being infectious. This is actually different from county to country so the results here are very inaccurate.<br>

    <h2>Math</h2>
    <p>
    We are using a very simple but illustrative model to simulate what could happen in the future, based on the logistic equation.
    </p>
    <h3>Reproduction rate and number</h3>
    <p>
        Let us assume that an infected person, on average, 
        is encountering every day a number &rho; of other persons.
        For each person he encounters, there is a 
        probability &phi; of infecting him (for instance if they shake hands, 
        or the infected person is sneezing while they meet etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Definition:</b>The reproduction rate r<sub>0</sub> is the number of new infections
        caused directly by an infected person during one day, if all other persons around him are susceptible: 
        r<sub>0</sub>= &rho; &times; &phi;
    </p>
    <p>
        If on day n there are I<sub>n</sub> infectious persons, and assuming all of them meet only susceptible persons (meaning: 
        persons which can be infected - i.e. they are not yet infected, nor immune) - then during one day, the 
        new number of infected persons is: 
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        &Delta;I<sub>n+1</sub> = r<sub>0</sub> &times; I<sub>n</sub>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Notes:</b> <br>
        1. If r<sub>0</sub> &le; 1, the disease cannot spread and disappears.<br>
        2. The reproduction rate is influenced by the social habits and behavior of the people 
        (by &rho;: how many 
        other people are met; by &phi;: do they shake hands? Do they embrace each other?
        Do they wash their hands on a regular base?).<br>
        3. It is also influenced by the disease itself (by &rho;: how it is transmitted?).<br>
        4. It is NOT influenced by the status of the other persons - i.e. if they are already immune or not. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Definition:</b> The <b>Infectious period &tau;</b> is the average duration an infected person remains
        infectious and can infect others (before being isolated). We use the value of 5 days in our calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Definition:</b> The <b>Active period &sigma;</b> is the average total duration an infected person remains
        infected. We use the value of 14 days in our calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Definition:</b> The <b>reproduction number R<sub>0</sub></b> is the number of persons directly infected
          by an infected person during his infection period.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        R<sub>0</sub> = r<sub>0</sub> &times; &tau;
    </p>
    <p> 
        Both r<sub>0</sub> and R<sub>0</sub> are defined under ideal conditions: it is assumed that 
        all other persons are susceptible. This is the case in the beginning of an epidemy, when the number of
        infectious and immune persons is negligible. 
        But after some time, our imaginary infected person will not only encounter susceptible persons, but also 
        active or immune persons.
        If the population of the country is P, the number of current infected persons is A (active), 
        R the recovered persons, then number of susceptible 
        persons is S = P - A - R, and the probability for our imaginary infected person to encounter a 
        susceptible person is s = S / P. The probability s will decrease from 1 towards 0 during an epidemy (we will see later that 
        often it will not reach 0).<br>
        If we consider the number of persons who die, D, the population will decrease over time, and on day n+1 we can write:
        The newly infected persons on day n can be written as:
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        &Delta;I<sub>n</sub> = r<sub>0</sub> &times; I<sub>n-1</sub> &times; s<sub>n-1</sub><br>
        s<sub>n</sub> = (P<sub>n</sub> - A<sub>n</sub> - R<sub>n</sub>) / P<sub>n</sub><br>
        P<sub>n</sub> = P<sub>n-1</sub> - D<sub>n</sub>
    </p>
    <p>
        The number of recovered persons on day n can be written as 
    </p>
    <div class="center">
        R<sub>n</sub> = R<sub>n-1</sub> + &Delta;I<sub>n-&tau;</sub>
    </div>
    And the number of infectious and infected persons on day n is:
    <p class="center">
        I<sub>n</sub> = I<sub>n-1</sub> + &Delta;I<sub>n</sub>- &Delta;I<sub>n-&tau;</sub><br>
        <br>
        A<sub>n</sub> = A<sub>n-1</sub> + &Delta;I<sub>n</sub> - &Delta;I<sub>n-&epsilon;</sub><br>
    </p>
    For now we assume there are no deaths:
    <p class="center">
        D<sub>n</sub> = 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all n
    </p>
    <p>
        Our result is a slightly more complex form of the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map" target="_blank">logistic map</a>. 
        Below we plot the series for the 2 indicators: A<sub>n</sub> and R<sub>n</sub>. 
        We quickly observe that the values of R and S have an asymptotic behavior so that not the whole population
        will be infected. A - the number of simultaneously ill persons - is growing exponential in the beginning, 
        reaches a maximum and the falls down exponentially back to 0. The amplitude of this maximum, the point 
        in time when is reached and the final values of R and S depends on the two unknown parameters of our
        series: &tau; and r<sub>0</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>Take your time and try out a few combinations for the values for of &tau; and r<sub>0</sub>. 
        The population P is chosen to be that 
        of {{currentCountry.country}}: {{currentCountry.population | number:"1.0-0"}}.

    <!-- <p style="font-size:larger">Simulation</p>
    <p>
    All measures taken by the government of your country try to influence the basic reproduction rate r<sub>0</sub> in such a way that 
    the health system is not getting overloaded. In particular, the critical cases C defined above shall not
    exceed the ICUs (Intensive Care Units) available in your country.
    At the same time, the cases needing hospitalization shall not exceed the number of available beds in the hospitals.<br>
    From data analysed up to now, it seems that about 4.5% of all cases needs hospitalization, and about 25% of them will need intensive care. One of the sources 
    of information is the <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Modellierung_Deutschland.pdf?__blob=publicationFile" target="_blank">
    Modellierung von Beispielszenarien der SARS-CoV-2-Epidemie 2020 in Deutschland</a>.

    <p>
    Below we run a simulation which starts with the initial values as currently reported for {{currentCountry.country}},
    and adjusts the reproduction rate R<sub>0</sub> every 14 days to a new value, so that
    the active infections will not exceed a value you choose, but will try to stay as high as possible below that number<br>
    The first graph shows the number of infected (A) and recovered (R) over time as reported until yesterday, from today onwards the simulated values.<br>
    The second graph shows the reproduction number: until today, measured on the reported value; from today onwards, 
    measured on the simulated data.

        The program starts with those values reported by JSU and tries to adjust the reproduction number in steps of 0.5,
        between 1 and 5, and tries to reach the number of simultaneously infected person you choose. The program will change 
        the value only once every 14 days. It is never going up more than one step of 0.5 - but if needed, it is allowed to
        go down as much as needed, but not below 1.
    </p> -->
    <p>Covid-19's basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> is estimated between 1.4 and 5.7, under "natural" 
        social behavior of the population, as we used to live before or during the start of this pandemic (see 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number" target="_blank">
            Wikipedia article on basic reproduction number</a>).<br>
        Social distancing and other (also hygienic) measures are reducing the basic reproduction number, attempting to
        bring it and keep it at a value lower than or around 1.<br> 
        Probably you can see in the simulation that any number larger than 1.4 is leading to a fast
        increase of simultaneously ill people, which would cause an overloaded health system.
        Probably it is going to take a long time until we will have the freedom to live as before...
